# Goals

- Review the codebase that has been provided
- Movies stored in `movies.json` should be displayed when the user visits the root path, the `App`
- The `App` component should include a form that is displayed on the root path as well
- Submitting the form should add movies to the "database"
- The list of movies on the main page should update immediately on form submission, without requiring a page refresh
